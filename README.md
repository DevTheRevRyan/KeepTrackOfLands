Keeping track of Lands [Modern Legal]

Hey guys. I made this file to have somewhat of an idea of what I had in my collection for relevant lands. 

The percentage stuff does not account for, Wooded Foothills being over 4 copies. Currently the cell will add the extra copies to the total, which basically renders that data point wrong/useless. It has not been useful to me overall - so I'll change it down the road or w/e.

Hope this saves some people some time and helps you organize your stuff.
